Notes about md5mesh/md5anim export.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use these exporters you should add "-md5" key to a command line options.
MeshAnimation/AnimSet objects are exported as multiple md5anim files (one
file per animation track). "bounds" section in md5anim is filled with dummy
data. Also, "hierarchy" section does not contain real skeleton hierarchy,
because Unreal Engine uses hierarchy from mesh, not from animations. Some md5
viewers/importers does require md5anim hierarchy, some - does not.
